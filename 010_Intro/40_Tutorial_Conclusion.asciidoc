=== Tutorial Conclusion

Hopefully, this little tutorial was a good demonstration about what is possible
in Elasticsearch.  It is really just scratching the surface, and many features--such as suggestions, geolocation, percolation, fuzzy and partial matching--were omitted to keep the tutorial short. But it did highlight just how
easy it is to start building advanced search functionality.  No configuration
was needed--just add data and start searching!

令人感到开心的是，这篇小教程对于解释 Elasticsearch 有哪些可能性，是一个不错的示例。为了保持教程足够精简，我们虽浅尝辄止，省略了诸如建议、地理定位、数据过滤、模糊及局部匹配等特性；但是它的的确确揭示了创建优秀的搜索功能并不是件难事。
不需要任何认证流程，只需要添加数据源并开始搜索吧。
